# Construct Mapping: Amazon ECS to Amazon EKS

> Loaded in Phase 1. Every construct found in the repository resolves to exactly one of three
> classifications. **The classification is fixed here, not decided per run.**

| Classification | Meaning | What the transformation does |
|---|---|---|
| **MECHANICAL** | A faithful equivalent exists and the conversion is deterministic | Convert it |
| **SCAFFOLD** | Partly automatable; the remainder is a design decision | Emit an incomplete artifact, clearly marked, plus a report item |
| **REPORT-ONLY** | No equivalent, or the substitute changes the guarantee | Do not touch. Report with the recommended path |

---

## Locating ECS definitions

| Source | What to find | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Terraform | `aws_ecs_task_definition`, `aws_ecs_service` | `container_definitions` is usually `jsonencode(local.x)`, `file()` or `templatefile()`. Read the local or template the argument points at. When the resources live in a module, each `module` block that calls it is one ECS service: resolve per-service values from that block's arguments |
| CloudFormation / CDK | `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition`, `AWS::ECS::Service` | CDK: read the synthesized template under `cdk.out/` if present; otherwise the construct code |
| JSON | files with `containerDefinitions` and `family` | Often next to a CI pipeline calling `register-task-definition` |

**Never evaluate an expression.** A value that is a variable, module output, local, `!Ref` or
`!GetAtt` becomes a placeholder (`REPLACE_ME_<NAME>`) plus a `TODO(migration)` quoting the
original expression. The one exception is a literal default in the same module
(`variable "x" { default = 3 }`), which may be used and must be cited in the report.

## MECHANICAL

### Task definition -> `apps/v1 Deployment`

| ECS | Kubernetes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `family` / Terraform module name | `metadata.name`, label `app.kubernetes.io/name` | Lowercase, DNS-1123 |
| `aws_ecs_service.desired_count` | `spec.replicas` | If Application Auto Scaling exists, also scaffold an HPA |
| `containerDefinitions[]` | `spec.template.spec.containers[]` | `name`, `image`, `command` -> `args`, `entryPoint` -> `command` |
| `essential: false` container | additional container in the same pod | Log routers (`firelens`) and OpenTelemetry collectors are reported, not copied (see REPORT-ONLY) |
| `dependsOn` (`START`, `HEALTHY`) | init container or native sidecar ordering | `COMPLETE`/`SUCCESS` on a short-lived container -> init container. Anything else -> `TODO(migration)` |
| `portMappings[].containerPort` | `ports[].containerPort` | Keep `name` so Services can target it |
| `readonlyRootFilesystem`, `user`, `privileged` | `securityContext` | `privileged: true` -> report as a Pod Security Admission blocker |
| `ulimits`, `linuxParameters` | none | Report |
| `stopTimeout` | `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | |

### cpu and memory -> `resources`

ECS allocates **1024 CPU units per vCPU**. `memory` is a hard limit (the container is killed
above it); `memoryReservation` is a soft reservation.

| ECS container field | Kubernetes |
|---|---|
| `cpu` | `requests.cpu` = units / 1024 (e.g. `512` -> `500m`) |
| `memory` | `limits.memory` (MiB -> `Mi`) |
| `memoryReservation` | `requests.memory` |
| `memory` only | `requests.memory` = `limits.memory` |

**Task-level only** (common on Fargate): with one essential container, assign the task-level
values to it. With several containers and no container-level values, split nothing: emit
`TODO(migration)` and a report entry, because any split is a guess.

### `environment` -> `env` / `ConfigMap`

Literal values become `env` entries. Values shared by more than one service move to a
`ConfigMap`. A value that is an IaC expression is a placeholder plus `TODO(migration)`.
Values that are clearly endpoints of dependencies (database host, cache URL, queue broker)
are never hardcoded: placeholder plus report entry.

### `secrets` -> `SecretProviderClass`

Each ECS `secrets[].valueFrom` is a Secrets Manager ARN (optionally with a `:json-key::`
suffix) or a Parameter Store ARN/name.

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
kind: SecretProviderClass
spec:
  provider: aws
  parameters:
    usePodIdentity: "true"      # omit on eks-fargate-profile (see below)
    objects: |
      - objectName: "REPLACE_ME_SECRET_ARN"   # TODO(migration): <original valueFrom expression>
        objectType: "secretsmanager"
        jmesPath:
          - path: password
            objectAlias: DB_PASSWORD
  secretObjects:                 # only when the app reads the value as an env var
    - secretName: <service>-secrets
      type: Opaque
      data:
        - objectName: DB_PASSWORD
          key: DB_PASSWORD
```

- A `:json-key::` suffix becomes a `jmesPath` entry.
- `secretObjects` sync requires the CSI volume to be mounted in the pod; mount it even when
  the app only reads env vars.
- **`eks-fargate-profile`**: the AWS provider (ASCP) does not support Fargate. Emit an
  `ExternalSecret` (External Secrets Operator) instead and report the operator as a
  prerequisite.

### ECS `healthCheck` -> probes

| ECS | Kubernetes |
|---|---|
| `command: ["CMD-SHELL", "..."]` | `livenessProbe.exec.command: ["sh", "-c", "..."]` |
| `command: ["CMD", ...]` | `livenessProbe.exec.command: [...]` |
| `interval`, `timeout`, `retries` | `periodSeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, `failureThreshold` |
| `startPeriod` | `startupProbe` with the same check, `failureThreshold * periodSeconds >= startPeriod` |

A `CMD-SHELL` check calling `curl localhost:<port>/<path>` may be rewritten as `httpGet` on
that port and path; cite the original in the report. The **readiness** probe comes from the
load balancer target group `health_check` (path, port, matcher) when one exists. Without one,
reuse the liveness check and mark it low risk.

### Service Connect and Cloud Map -> `Service`

| ECS | Kubernetes |
|---|---|
| `service_connect_configuration.service[].client_alias.dns_name` (or `discovery_name`, or the `port_name`) | `Service.metadata.name` |
| `client_alias.port` | `Service.spec.ports[].port` |
| the named `portMappings` entry | `targetPort` (by name) |
| Service Connect `namespace` | Kubernetes namespace (Phase 0 default) |
| `service_registries` (Cloud Map DNS) | `Service` named after the registry service |

Clients calling `http://catalog` or `http://catalog:80` keep working when the `Service` has the
same short name in the same namespace. A `dns_name` containing dots, or a Cloud Map namespace
shared across clusters, cannot be reproduced by name: `TODO(migration)` and report.
Services with `client_alias` absent (client-only Service Connect) get no `Service`.

**Every** alias, registry and load balancer target gets a `Service`. A Deployment without the
Service its clients resolve is the most common silent gap.

### Load balancer -> `Ingress` or `HTTPRoute`

Driven by `ingress_strategy` (default `alb-ingress`).

| ECS / ELB | `alb-ingress` | `gateway-api` |
|---|---|---|
| `load_balancer { target_group_arn, container_name, container_port }` | `Ingress` backend -> the `Service` | `HTTPRoute` backendRef -> the `Service` |
| listener rule path / host conditions | `rules[].http.paths` / `host` | `matches[]` |
| internet-facing / internal scheme | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme` | Gateway listener, reported |
| target group health check | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path` + readinessProbe | readinessProbe |

`ingressClassName`: `alb` for the AWS Load Balancer Controller on `eks-standard`; on
`eks-auto-mode` the class must use controller `eks.amazonaws.com/alb`: emit that
`IngressClass` (+ `IngressClassParams`) once. Certificates, WAF and listener TLS policy are
placeholders plus report entries; the ALB, its listeners and security groups stay in the
source IaC and are not recreated.

### Task role -> `ServiceAccount` + identity

| `migration_target` | Emit |
|---|---|
| `eks-auto-mode`, `eks-standard` | `ServiceAccount` with **no** role annotation, plus `eks/iam/pod-identity.tf` (Terraform sources) or a report table (other sources) with one `aws_eks_pod_identity_association` per service |
| `eks-fargate-profile` | `ServiceAccount` with `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` (IRSA), because Pod Identity is not available on Fargate |

The workload role's trust policy changes: Pod Identity trusts the service principal
`pods.eks.amazonaws.com` with `sts:AssumeRole` and `sts:TagSession`. The task role trusted
`ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com`. Report the trust-policy change; never edit the source role.
`eks-standard` also needs the `eks-pod-identity-agent` add-on (built into Auto Mode): report it.

---

## SCAFFOLD

### Execution role -> permission redistribution

Nothing in a pod assumes an execution role. Split its permissions by who needs them on EKS:

| Execution role permission | On EKS it belongs to | Action |
|---|---|---|
| ECR pull (`AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`, `ecr:*`) | the node role | Report (usually already present) |
| CloudWatch Logs (`logs:CreateLogStream`, `logs:PutLogEvents`) | the log agent's role | Report |
| `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`, `ssm:GetParameters`, `kms:Decrypt` for the task's secrets | **the workload's own role** (the CSI provider uses the pod identity) | Add to the emitted Pod Identity role policy, or report with the exact statements |

Missing the third row is a silent failure: the pod stays in `ContainerCreating` with a
mount error.

### `awsvpc` security groups -> pod security groups

| `migration_target` | Emit | Guarantee change |
|---|---|---|
| `eks-standard` | `SecurityGroupPolicy` (`vpcresources.k8s.aws/v1beta1`) per service, `podSelector` on the service label; report `ENABLE_POD_ENI=true` on the VPC CNI and supported instance types | Per-service, same as ECS |
| `eks-fargate-profile` | `SecurityGroupPolicy` per service; the list must include the cluster security group | Per-service |
| `eks-auto-mode` | `NodeClass` with `podSecurityGroupSelectorTerms` + `podSubnetSelectorTerms` and a `NodePool` per distinct security-group set | **Class-level**: all pods on the NodeClass share the groups. Security Groups for Pods is not supported on Auto Mode. Report the granularity loss and suggest NetworkPolicies for pod-to-pod rules |

Security group ids are placeholders quoting the source expression. Rules that only allow
traffic from other ECS tasks' groups must be re-expressed; report each one.

### Application Auto Scaling -> `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`

`ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization` target -> `metrics[].resource.cpu.target.averageUtilization`
(requires `requests.cpu`). Memory likewise. ALB request count or custom CloudWatch metrics ->
`TODO(migration)`; report KEDA or an external metrics adapter as the options. `min_capacity`
/ `max_capacity` -> `minReplicas` / `maxReplicas`.

### Capacity providers -> Karpenter `NodePool`

Only for `eks-standard`. `FARGATE_SPOT` weights -> `karpenter.sh/capacity-type: spot`
requirement as a comment-annotated scaffold. On Auto Mode, report that capacity is managed and
the built-in `general-purpose` NodePool may suffice.

### `CODE_DEPLOY` -> Argo Rollouts `Rollout`

Blue/green with the traffic-shift settings copied as comments. Marked incomplete.

### Placement -> scheduling

`spread` on `attribute:ecs.availability-zone` -> `topologySpreadConstraints` on
`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`. `distinctInstance` -> pod anti-affinity on
`kubernetes.io/hostname`. `memberOf` expressions and `binpack` -> `TODO(migration)`.

### `awslogs` -> log routing note

The log group name and stream prefix are recorded per service so the cluster log agent
(CloudWatch Observability add-on or Fluent Bit) can route to the same destination. No
manifest is emitted per service.

## REPORT-ONLY

| Construct | Why | Recommended path |
|---|---|---|
| Service Connect retries, outlier detection, timeouts, TLS, proxy metrics | Managed proxy features with no manifest equivalent | Accept, move to application-level retries, or adopt a service mesh (Istio add-on) |
| `firelens` log router container | ECS-specific log driver | Cluster log agent |
| OpenTelemetry / X-Ray sidecar | Usually cluster-wide on EKS | ADOT or CloudWatch Observability add-on |
| EventBridge rules on ECS task/service events | ECS-emitted events | Kubernetes events, Argo/Flux notifications, or CloudWatch Container Insights |
| ECS Exec | ECS control plane feature | `kubectl exec` with RBAC |
| Container Insights setting | Cluster setting on ECS | CloudWatch Observability add-on |
| `bridge` / `host` network mode | Dynamic host ports have no equivalent | `hostNetwork` only with a design review |
| Task metadata endpoint usage in code | Different contract | Downward API |
| EFS / bind-mount volumes | Storage design decision | EFS CSI driver `PersistentVolume`, scaffold on request |
| `privileged`, `linuxParameters.capabilities`, `ulimits` | Pod Security Admission impact | Namespace PSA level decision |
