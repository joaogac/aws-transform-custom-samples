# Benchmark Results - Amazon ECS to Amazon EKS

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Repositories tested | 2 real public ECS repositories, pinned to a commit |
| IaC formats covered | Terraform (modules + `jsonencode` locals) and CloudFormation |
| Migration targets covered | `eks-auto-mode` and `eks-standard` |
| Transformation outputs complete | **2/2** (`MIGRATION_REPORT.md` status `complete` in both) |
| **Source integrity** | **0 files modified outside `eks/` and the report, in both runs** |
| Files emitted | 23 (`retail-store-sample-app`) and 12 (`ecs-refarch-cloudformation`) |
| YAML parse failures | **0** of 34 |
| `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` on core kinds | **0 failures** |
| ECS-only fields surviving in emitted YAML | **0** in both runs |
| `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotations (IRSA) | **0** in both runs (Pod Identity targets) |
| `TODO(migration)` markers | 26 and 17, every emitting file referenced in the report |
| `MIGRATION_REPORT.md` | 25.8 KB and 18.3 KB |
| Total agent minutes | 140.70 |
| Total estimated cost | ~US$ 4.92 (at US$ 0.035 / agent minute) |

Both runs reached the 70 agent-minute cap passed with `--limit 70` and exited with code 2
after their work was written: each run's worklog records the final file list and a passing
validation before the cap. The measurements below are taken from the emitted files, not
from the agent's own summary.

### Methodology

The fixtures are **real public repositories**, not hand-written ones, pinned to a commit so the
result stays reproducible:

| Repo | Licence | Commit | IaC | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app` | MIT-0 | `d7a380b843e0759e58754f74188ea18252a51415` | Terraform | `eks-auto-mode` |
| `aws-samples/ecs-refarch-cloudformation` | Apache-2.0 | `a257e226b33bd9d2a721e5afd9d7e8b66dbacfdc` | CloudFormation | `eks-standard` |

`ecs-refarch-cloudformation` is archived upstream. It is used because it is an AWS-published
CloudFormation ECS layout on EC2 capacity with `bridge` networking, which exercises paths the
Terraform fixture does not.

Real repositories were chosen over a hand-authored fixture for the same reason as the other
community samples: a fixture written by the author of the mapping contains only the constructs
the mapping already knows. `retail-store-sample-app` declares its five services once, in a
shared Terraform module instantiated per service, with container definitions built by
`jsonencode(...)` and Service Connect for service-to-service calls. `ecs-refarch-cloudformation`
uses nested CloudFormation stacks wired through `!Ref` / `!GetAtt` outputs and Application
Auto Scaling.

Each repository was cloned at the pinned commit, then transformed with a plan context that only
sets the target and gives no ECS-specific hints:

```bash
atx custom def exec -n ecs-to-eks -p . -x -t \
  --configuration file://config.json --limit 70
```

```text
retail-store-sample-app:     migration_target: eks-auto-mode, ingress_strategy: alb-ingress, namespace: retail-store
ecs-refarch-cloudformation:  migration_target: eks-standard,  ingress_strategy: alb-ingress, namespace: ecs-refarch
```

The build command was an external, deterministic gate the agent does not author: `eks/` exists,
every YAML parses, no ECS-only field survives outside comments, and the report exists.

Assertions are **invariants**, not expected findings, because a real repository has no answer
key: source integrity, output existence, zero ECS field leakage, YAML validity, client dry-run
on core kinds, the IAM mechanism matching the target, `TODO`/report pairing, the exact
`## Manual Action Items` heading, and no em dash.

|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Every Phase 1 construct appears in the report with its classification | PASS (63 inventory rows) | PASS (38 inventory rows) |
| 2 | Originals byte-identical; output under `eks/`; report at root; nothing else at root | PASS | PASS |
| 3 | Zero ECS-only fields in emitted Kubernetes YAML | PASS | PASS |
| 4 | YAML parses; core kinds clean under `--dry-run=client`; CRD kinds listed with their CRD | PASS | PASS |
| 5 | One `Deployment` + `ServiceAccount` per service; a `Service` per alias / registry / target | PASS (5 / 5 / 5) | PASS (2 / 2 / 2) |
| 6 | IAM mechanism matches the target (Pod Identity, no role-arn annotation) | PASS | PASS |
| 7 | Task role and execution-role secret grants on the workload role or in the report | PASS (catalog, orders) | PASS (no task or execution role in source; reported) |
| 8 | No secret value inlined | PASS | PASS (no secrets in source) |
| 9 | Every `awsvpc` security group carried by the target mechanism or reported | PASS (`NodeClass`, class-level, reported) | PASS (`SecurityGroupPolicy` per service) |
| 10 | Every `TODO(migration)` in `## Manual Action Items`, and vice versa | PASS (11 items) | PASS (8 items) |
| 11 | Unresolved IaC expressions quoted verbatim, never evaluated | PASS | PASS |

The emitted Terraform (`eks/iam/pod-identity.tf`) passes `terraform fmt -check`. The report
text and all emitted files contain no em dash.

## What the Runs Showed

**The Terraform module layout resolved without hints.** The v0.1.0 development run was given the
module path in its plan context. In this round the plan context carried no ECS-specific
guidance, and the run still followed `terraform/lib/ecs/service` through each of the five
`module` instantiations, resolving per-service values from each block's arguments.

**Service Connect split exactly as classified.** Each of the five aliases became a `Service`
with the same short name and `port: 80 -> targetPort` by port name, so clients calling
`http://catalog` keep resolving. Each service also received a REPORT-ONLY entry for the proxy
features (retries, outlier detection, timeouts) the `Service` does not reproduce.

**Execution-role secret grants moved to the workload identity.** `catalog` and `orders` read
database and broker credentials through the execution role on ECS. Both `SecretProviderClass`
objects use `usePodIdentity: "true"`, and `pod-identity.tf` plus the report's IAM
Redistribution table carry the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` / `kms:Decrypt` grants onto the
workload roles.

**The two targets took different security-group paths.** On `eks-auto-mode` the run emitted a
`NodeClass` with `podSecurityGroupSelectorTerms` and reported that the groups become
class-level. On `eks-standard` it emitted one `SecurityGroupPolicy` per service and reported the
`ENABLE_POD_ENI=true` prerequisite on the VPC CNI.

**`bridge` networking was reported, not approximated.** `ecs-refarch-cloudformation` runs on EC2
with `bridge` mode and dynamic host ports. The run converted the containers and reported the
network mode as a medium-risk manual action rather than emitting `hostPort`s.

**Literal values were copied, not invented.** The CloudFormation fixture hardcodes its image URIs
in the template. With no `registry` set, the run left those references as they are in the
source.

### Known cost

Both runs used their full 70 agent-minute budget, about the same as the `openshift-to-eks`
round (~71 per repository). Because the report skeleton is written first and updated as each
phase completes, the report was already complete when the cap was reached. For larger estates,
raise `--limit`, or resume with `atx --conversation-id <id> -t --limit <higher>`.
